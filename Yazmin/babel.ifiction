			<description>
			An experimental project in the final days of Infocom,
			"Zork I: Das Große Unterweltreich" was never completed or
			released: this story file is a beta-testing copy much prized
			by collectors.
			<br/>
			As a literary work of translation, it is not
			altogether successful, but it led to technical work on
			Infocom's interpreter and virtual machine to accommodate
			German diacritics and quotation marks: and this work remains
			the foundation of the Z-machine's support for non-English
			prose today.

			<description>
			An old, oddly youthful man turns toward you slowly. His long,
			silver hair dances about him as a fresh breeze blows. "You have
			reached the final test, my friend! You are proved clever and
			powerful, but this is not yet enough! Seek me when you feel
			yourself worthy!"
			<br/>
			Zork III: The Dungeon Master draws you into the deepest and
			most mysterious reaches of the Great Underground Empire. Nothing
			is as it seems. And the one responsible for the shadow and
			darkness - the Dungeon Master - embodies the greatest mystery
			of all.
			<br/>
			In this test of wisdom and courage, you will face countless
			dangers. But what awaits you at the culmination of your odyssey
			is well worth risking all.
			<br/>
			Difficulty: Advanced

			<description>
			The Wizard appears, floating nonchalantly in the air beside
			you. He grins sideways at you.
			<br/>
			The Wizard incants "Fantasize," but nothing happens. He shakes
			his wand. Nothing happens. With a slightly embarrassed glance in
			your direction, he vanishes.
			<br/>
			Expect the unexpected when you take on Zork II: The Wizard of
			Frobozz.
			<br/>
			As you explore the subterranean realm of Zork, you'll continually
			be confronted with new surprises. Chief among these is the Wizard
			himself, who'll constantly endeavor to confound you with his
			capricious powers. But more than that, you'll face a challenge
			the likes of which you've never experienced before.

			<description>
			The Great Underground Empire is in its heyday. Upscale condos
			crowd the massive caverns. Subterranean highways stretch from
			Aragain to the Fublio Valley. And no adventurer has yet set foot
			in the open field west of the white house.
			<br/>
			But now both town and countryside are being abandoned, their
			inhabitants fleeing in the wake of a dread wizard's curse. The
			curse has already disposed of the royal Flathead family. It
			threatens to destroy the whole kingdom - unless you can stop it.
			<br/>
			Your quest will take you to every corner of the empire, as you
			seek out objects ranging from the absurd to the sublime. The
			quixotic jester will test you with games, riddles, and tricks.
			And the immense Flathead palace and its environs offer a
			multitude of surprises.
			<br/>
			Zork Zero combines the best of the legendary Zorkian universe
			with the latest technology in interactive storytelling. It has
			all the richness and depth you expect from Infocom interactive
			fiction. Author Stever Meretzky, whose award-winning stories
			include Planetfall, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and
			Leather Goddesses of Phobos, lends his characteristic whimsy
			to the tale.

			February 1938, Los Angeles. FDR's New Deal is finally rolling.
			Hitler's rolling, too; this time through Austria. But as
			Chief Detective for a quiet burgh on the outskirts of L.A.,
			you've got other fish to fry.
			<br/>
			One gilt-edged society dame is dead. And now it looks like some
			two-bit grifter is putting the screws to her multi-millionaire
			old man. Then you step in, and the shakedown turns ugly. You're
			left with a stiff and race against the clock to nail your
			suspect... unless you get nailed first!
			<br/>
			Nobody said a sordid family affair like this was going to be a
			cinch. Everyone from the knock-out heiress to the poker-faced
			butler may end up in the slammer before it's over. Ahead of you
			is a Gordian knot of motives and alibis. And the only testimony
			you can trust is that of your own eyes - because you are The
			Witness.

			a stone possessing undreamt-of powers. For though the note in
			question is addressed to someone in your ordinary little town,
			it's postmarked for Special Delivery to Parts Unknown. And its

			"The time is out of joint; O curse spite,
			That ever I was born to set it right!" - Hamlet I.v.
			<br/>
			It's the last day of your $599 London vacation. Unfortunately,
			it's also the first day of World War III. Only seconds remain
			before an H-bomb vaporizes the city... and you with it.
			<br/>
			Unless you escape to another time, another dimension.
			<br/>
			For every atomic explosion unlocks the door to a secret
			universe; a plane between fantasy and reality, filled with
			curious artifacts and governed by its own mischievous logic.
			You'll crisscross time and space as you explore this
			fascinating universe, learning to control its inexorable power.
			<br/>
			Trinity leads you on a journey back to the dawn of the atomic
			age... and puts the course of history in your hands.

			They said you would sleep for half a millennium - not an
			unreasonable length of time, considering you'd be in limited
			cryogenic suspension. Your body would rest at the planet's
			nerve center, an underground complex 20 miles beneath the
			surface. Your brain, they told you, would be wired to a network
			of computers; your mind would continue to operate at a minimal
			level, overseeing maintenance of surface-side equilibrium. And
			you would not awake, so they promised, until your 500 years
			had elapsed - barring, of course, the most dire emergency.
			<br/>
			Then, and only them, you would be awakened to save your planet
			by strategically manipulating six robots, each of whom perceives
			the world differently. But such a catastrophe, you have been
			assured, could not possibly occur.
			<br/>
			Good morning.

			You're guilty until proven innocent.
			<br/>
			You have walked into a hotbed of deceit and trickery. And now

			And until you can prove them wrong, you're guilty as charged -
			murder.
			<br/>
			Among society's upper crust, murder is the kind of nastiness
			that must be cleared up quickly. So isn't it convenient that
			you, a struggling journalist looking for a good time and a
			good story, end up the scapegoat? The evidence is stacked
			against you, and you're being forced to prove your own
			innocence. And someone else's guilt. But no one wants to help
			you. You're an outsider. And only an outsider could be so rude
			as to accept an invitation to the social event of the season.
			Then spoil it all.

			<description>
			What a trotting krip! Since your incredible heroics in Planetfall,
			where you risked life and limb to save the planet Resida, things
			have hardly changed at all. Sure, you were promoted to Lieutenant
			First Class, but this only meant that your dull life of cleaning
			grotch cages was replaced by an equally dull life of paperwork.
			Now you've got another assignment tailor-made for a grotchbrain:
			pilot a spacetruck to a nearby station to pick up a load of
			trivial forms. Trot and doublt trot!
			<br/>
			But all is not lost. By a happy twist of fate, your companion
			for the journey is your old pal Floyd! That's right, it's the
			same mischievous little robot, crayons and paddleball at the
			ready, who was your helpful buddy in Planetfall.
			<br/>
			Getting to the space station is easy. But once there, you find
			it strangely deserted. Even the seedy space village surrounding
			the station is missing its ragtag tenants. A spooky alien ship
			carrying only an empty pedestal rests in a docking bay. An
			ostrich and an Arcturian balloon creature are found, abandoned
			but in perfect health. The commander's log describes the
			mysterious breakdown of machiner, demonstrated by a roving
			hull-welder who seems bent on your destruction. And finally even
			Floyd begins acting oddly...
			<br/>
			Steve Meretzky, whose interactive fiction successes include
			The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Leather Goddesses of
			Phobos, won a Best Computer Software Designer award for Planetfall.
			Infocom fans, consistently rating Planetfall among their favorite
			computer games, have been begging for a sequel. Even if you've
			never played Planetfall, you will enjoy Stationfall: the
			puzzles will challenge your intellect, the humor will keep you
			laughing, and Floyd will win your heart.

			Experience the sweeping drama and power of James Clavell's
			Shogun.
			<br/>
			The year is 1600. You are John Blackthorne, Pilot-Major of a
			privateering merchant ship and the first Englishman to set foot
			on Japanese soil. Thrust into the exotic culture of feudal Japan,
			you must rely on your wits and sheer physical strength to survive.
			As you are drawn into the political intrigue and teeming violence,
			your most basic beliefs and assumptions will be tested. Act with
			care: in a land where honor is valued above life itself, you make
			a wrong decision at your peril.
			<br/>
			In this interactive adaptation, Dave Lebling - co-author of the
			enormously popular Zork series - captures all the drama and
			spell-binding style of James Clavell's matchless novel. Color
			graphics crafted in the exquisite style of 16th century Japanese
			court painters illustrate the unfolding saga. Infocom's new,
			friendlier parser understands more commands than ever. And if you
			ever need help, on-screen hints will lead you back to the action.

			<description>
			Moriarty has set a deadly trap for Sherlock Holmes. And only
			you can stop him...
			<br/>
			Travel back in time to Victorian London, where the city is
			bustling with preparations for Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee.
			Crowds of sightseers and souvenir vendors fill the streets
			in eager anticipation of the Jubilee Week events. Newspapers
			detail the gala array of festivities. Sumptuous receptions
			for foreign dignitaries. Special services at Westminster Abbey.
			A Royal Procession through the streets of London. And the
			Queen reigning over all, resplendent in the Crown Jewels.
			<br/>
			At least, that's the official plan. Unbeknownst to the celebrants
			thronging the cit, a crisis has arisen: the Crown Jewels have been
			stolen from the Tower of London. If they're not recovered before
			the festivities begin, the theft will be exposed and the
			government will fall into international disgrace.
			<br/>
			Only 48 hours remain to solve the crime. With Scotland Yard
			failing to make headway, the Prime Minister calls on Sherlock
			Holmes, the famous consulting detective. But riddles left at
			the scene of the crime include a direct challenge to Holmes,
			who suspects a deadly trap. To throw the scoundrel off his
			guard, Holmes turns the investigation over to you, his
			trusted cohort, Dr. Watson.
			<br/>
			With Holmes by your side, you use your wits, intuition, and
			a myriad of clues to solve the riddles and piece together the
			mystery. Your search for the jewels and the villain leads you
			all over London, from the most popular tourist attractions to
			the seediest back alleys. As Big Ben strikes each successive
			hour and dangerous complications impede your progress, you
			realize you're facing that most dastardly of foes, Holmes's
			archnemesis... the vile Professor Moriarty.
			<br/>
			Sherlock: The Riddle of the Crown Jewels is the first story
			in Inform's new Immortal Legends series, developed by Challenge,
			Inc. Using Infocom's sophisticated development tools, Challenge
			lends its own brand of puzzles and plotting to interactive
			fiction. In The Riddle of the Crown Jewels, author Bob Bates
			brings Holmes's London to life, filling it with familiar
			characters and locations. On-screen hints provide clues when
			your magnifying glass falls short of the task.
			<br/>
			And now, come, Watson! The game is afoot...

			There's something down there in the ocean, something terrifying.
			And you have to face it - because only you can save the Aquadome,
			the world's first undersea research station.
			<br/>
			The alarm sounds and your submarine, the Scimitar, is docked
			nearby. But not so fast - you haven't even tested the Scimitar
			in deep water, and the crew at the Aquadome may have a traitor
			in its ranks. So be careful! You have many possibilities to
			consider, mysteries to unravel and life-and-death decisions to
			make!
			<br/>
			Success won't come easily. It may not come at all - because,
			if you challenge the deep without using all your wits, you
			just might wind up as shark bait!
			<br/>
			Difficulty: Junior

			<description>
			In the 17th century, the seas are as wild as the untamed heart
			of a young woman. But when you set out on the schooner Lafond
			Deux, bound for the West Indies, your thoughts are only of your
			ailing father who awaits your care. Little do you know that your
			innocent journey will soon turn to dangerous adventure.
			<br/>
			You barely survive an encounter with pirates, whose plans for
			you include a fate worse than death. The explosives, the rocky
			reefs, the vicious crocodile - all these are obstacles which you
			must overcome with cunning and agility. True, it's not easy; but
			at least you can control your fate. What you cannot control is
			much more dangerous: your passion for Nicholas Jamison, the
			handsome pirate captain.
			<br/>
			Tall and lean, with azure eyes that penetrate deep into your
			soul, he makes your blood quicken despite his unsavory past.
			When you're in his arms, swirling around the dance floor or
			secluded in the flowered depths of the gazebo, you are apt to
			forget your mission.
			<br/>
			But don't dally too long with Nick. For your father is waiting,
			and on his rescue lies the fate of more than one man. Prepare
			for adventure on the high seas, lass. You'll need every bit of
			pluck you can muster.
			<br/>
			In Plundered Hearts, Infocom brings your wildest fantasies to life.
			You'll throll to spine-tingling peril, heart-pounding romance,
			and challenging predicaments. To create this exotic adventure,
			author Amy Briggs read hundreds of romance novels, researched
			17th century costumes and ships, and was wooed by a dashing pirate.

			<title>Nord and Bert Couldn't Make Head Nor Tail Of It</title>
			<author>Jeff O'Neill</author>

			<headline>Infocom interactive fiction</headline>
			<firstpublished>1987</firstpublished>
			<genre>Comedy</genre>
			<group>Infocom</group>
			<description>
			You are standing at the edge of a barren field. A steady wind,
			having secreted away the topsoil, is now drifting sandy dirt
			across the plain. A scant sign of life here is a freshly-burrowed
			molehill on the ground.
			<br/>
			&gt;MAKE A MOUNTAIN OUT OF THE MOLEHILL
			<br/>
			There is a tremendous rumbling in the distance, getting louder
			and louder, until it is deafening. The dirt around the molehill
			crumbles away as mighty, jagged granite peaks emerge from deep
			underground. The surrounding landscape transforms into a fertile
			valley before your very eyes.
			<br/>
			Infocom's first collection of short stories takes you to a place
			where nothing is quite as it seems. It's a place where you really
			can make a mountain out of a molehill, where "the fur is flying"
			is taken literally, and where a bow can be turned into a beau.
			<br/>
			Each of the eight stories in Nord and Bert Couldn't Make Head
			or Tail of It involves a different type of wordplay. You'll find
			yourself challenging your wits and your memory to come up with
			the clichés, spoonerisms, and other verbal trickeries needed to
			complete the puzzles. But don't view this as a hard row to hoe.
			Nord and Bert contains built-in hints, which you can call upon
			when the going gets rough.
			<br/>
			All eight stories take place in the mixed-up town of Punster.
			However, no two contain the same people, locations, or objects.
			Each is played independently of the others, although you'll use
			passwords obtained in seven of the stories to get into the
			eighth. As for mapping, it's out of the window. You simply type
			where you want to go.
			<br/>
			The tall tales in Nord and Bert are every bit as fun and clever
			as Infocom's other interactive fiction stories. They can each
			be completed in one sitting, making them a highly entertaining
			way to spend an evening, alone or with friends. Nord and Bert
			was authored by Jeff O'Neill, whose mind is constantly working
			on artful new turns of phrase.

			More ghosts haunt the misty sea-coast and stone ramparts of
			Cornwall than anyplace else on earth. One such soul roams
			Tresyllian Castle: a pale phantom with flaxen hair and a
			luminous, flowing gown. It seems like a fanciful legend...
			until the spectral "White Lady" threatens the life of your
			friend Tamara!
			<br/>
			Arriving at the fog-shrouded castle, you meet a cast of
			eccentric characters ranging from a blue-blood debutante to
			an overly helpful butler. Has one of them donned the ghostly
			guise of the White Lady? Or has the drowned lover of Lord
			Jack, Tamara's fiancé, returned to haunt her successor?
			Perhaps the spectre is seeking the valuable treasure hidden
			somewhere in the lavish rooms and secret passageways of the
			castle. The solution to the mystery, as well as the location
			of the treasure, changes in each of the four variations of
			Moonmist.
			<br/>
			Get ready to spend the night in a haunted castle. But don't
			sleep too soundly. The next victim might be you.

			<description>
			This story file is a condensed version of Zork I, Infocom's most
			popular title, reduced to make it viable for the cassette-based
			Commodore 64. The only Infocom story file ever to be intended to
			run from cassette rather than disk, the Mini-Zork has been compared
			to a Reader's Digest edition of a classic. The Mini-Zork is one of
			several remakings of Zork from the final years of Infocom: there
			were also the Solid Gold edition, the never-completed German
			translation and the sequels Beyond Zork and Zork Zero.
			<br/>
			Mini-Zork I had a brief shelf-life in computer shops, in Activision
			packaging, but it is now best known for its magazine release.
			In November 1990, a year after Infocom had effectively become
			defunct, the Mini-Zork was given away with the British Commodore
			users' magazine "Zzap! 64" no. 67, which is now a collector's item.

			<description>
			Ever since you arrived at G.U.E. Tech, you've heard stories
			about the creepy old campus basements and storage rooms, some
			so ancient that they contain only rotting piles of unidentifiable
			junk. Until now, you've never ventured lower than the ground
			floors of the monolithic classroom and dorm buildings, avoiding
			the warren of tunnels that connect them.
			<br/>
			But tonight, something draws you down into the mysterious depths
			of the institute. Perhaps it's the blizzard raging outside,
			making the outdoors as threatening as anything you could imagine
			within. Perhaps it's the nightmare you had, hinting at horrific
			mysteries below and leaving you with a strange object that seems
			to lead you inexorably downward. Or perhaps it's just another
			way for you to avoid writing that twenty page term paper you have
			due tomorrow.
			<br/>
			In any event, you soon find yourself wandering away from your
			computer and into the dark nether regions of G.U.E. Tech. Suddenly,
			you're in a world that rivals your most hideous visions, a realm
			of horror lurking beneath the calm corridors and study halls.
			<br/>
			Shapes emerge from dark corridors. Eerie sounds draw closer.
			Slimy passageways lead to sights so horrifying that they will
			feed your nightmares for weeks.
			<br/>
			The Lurking Horror recalls the ghastly visions of H. P. Lovecraft
			and Stephen King, as author Dave Lebling turns an everyday world
			into a frightening web of uncertainty. The numerous puzzles will
			challenge both first-time and experienced players, and Lebling's
			chilling descriptions will leave you with images you'll never
			forget.

			<description>
			Have you mettle enough to make siege on the Dread Lord himself?
			...We shall see.
			<br/>
			If you've ever been spellbound by a fantasy story, captivated
			by a role playing game, or enthralled by interactive fiction,
			Journey will rouse your imagination to new heights.
			<br/>
			Join us in our Journey. Travel beyond the known boundaries of
			interactive software into a new world of computer storytelling.
			Marc Blank - the pioneering co-author of the enormously popular
			Zork and Enchanter trilogies - weaves a fabulous tale of great
			adventure, drawing from the highest art of storytelling and the
			excitement of role playing games to create a fascinating
			new kind of computer entertainment.
			<br/>
			In Journey, you become part of a mesmerizing epic created in the
			tradition of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. For five
			long years, failed crops, tainted water, and sickness have
			blighted a peaceful land. Brave villagers have set forth to find
			relief for their suffering region, but none have returned. Now,
			yet another small band is preparing the begin the odyssey.
			You'll share the adventures of Tag, Praxix, Bergon, Esher, and
			Minar as they solve puzzles, overcome obstacles, explore unknown
			lands.
			<br/>
			Pass into the world of Journey with ease. The game is simple to
			learn: your challenge lies in choosing the right path, casting
			the best spell, and knowing whether to lie or tell the truth.
			Your imagination will be taxed more and more with each passing
			day as the difficulties become increasingly complex.
			<br/>
			As the tale unfolds, you become acquainted with the characters
			and their personalities. Each character acts on his own, sometimes
			advancing the quest, sometimes hindering it. You help them decide
			where to explore and what actions to take, taking part in their
			strategies and problem-solving.
			<br/>
			The intrigue of a masterfully told story. The thrill of being a
			part of a great adventure. The challenge of leading the tale to
			its climactic conclusion. This is what makes Journey a uniquely
			compelling entertainment.

			<description>
			Vampire Penguins. A Corpse Line. Meltdown on Elm Street. Who could
			forget these classic Hollywood movies produced by your uncle,
			Buddy Burbank? But his greatest masterpiece has yet to be
			experienced... Hollywood Hijinx, starring you!
			<br/>
			Your Uncle Buddy and Aunt Hildegarde have passed away, but their
			memory lives on in their Malibu mansion, filled with a lifetime
			of Hollywood memorabilia. And you've inherited it all, with one
			stipulation - you can only claim your booty if you find the
			treasures hidden throughout the sprawling beachfront estate.
			If you can't find the treasures in one night, you lose the whole
			caboodle.
			<br/>
			It's just the sort of thing you'd expect from Aunt Hildegarde
			and Uncle Buddy. And their home is familiar territory: you spent
			your childhood summers there with your Cousin Herman. Although
			some say the house is haunted, you're not fooled. You know that
			Uncle Buddy, who wore a different polyester leisure suit each
			day of the week, was always rigging the place with goofy gags
			and booby traps.
			<br/>
			Inside the house, everything is just as glitzy and full of fun
			as you remember it to be. There's the luxurious private screening
			room, the gold-plated bathroom faucets in the shape of Oscars,
			and the wacky props from old Buddy Burbank movies.
			<br/>
			The Malibu estate seems like a funhouse at first. But the puzzles
			you must solve prove that Aunt Hildegarde and Uncle Buddy weren't
			just kidding around. Claiming the Burbank bundle turns out to be
			quite a challenge - and it's all in your honor.
			<br/>
			Hollywood Hijinx is as zany as its author, "Hollywood" Dave
			Anderson. It's cram-packed with puzzles that will test the wits
			and tickle the ribs of both first time and experienced players.
			<br/>
			Difficulty: Standard

			In Enchanter, the first of a spellbinding series in the tradition

			To defeat him, you will have to match your skills as a necromancer

			<br/>
			If you succeed, you will be elevated to a seat in the illustrious
			Circle; if you fail, your land will be doomed to an eternity of

			<description>
			Twelve hours to solve the mystery. One false move, and the killer
			strikes again.
			<br/>
			It's been called "part of the latest craze in home computing (TIME
			magazine), an "amazing feat of programming" (THE NEW YORK TIMES)
			and the "Best Adventure of 1983" (ELECTRONIC GAMES).
			<br/>
			It's Deadline, and it puts you, the keen-eyed sleuth, against a
			12-hour time limit to solve a classic locked-door mystery. Armed
			only with the clues inside this package and your own wits, you
			must sift through myriads of evidence and motives to track down
			the killer. No easy feat, for all six of your suspects exercise
			free will - coming and going, scheming and maneuvering
			independently of your actions. And some of these personalities
			are so treacherous that, should you make the wrong move, one
			of them may do you in.
			<br/>
			Difficulty: Expert.

			You're about to get yourself into very deep trouble.
			<br/>
			You're a backwater island's top diver and foremost expert on
			local shipwrecks. Which makes you perfect for the job a band of
			the island's shadiest characters has in mind for you. It's a
			simple business proposition: all you have to do is locate and
			salvage a fortune in sunken treasure. You stand to gain
			millions. The only drawback is, it could cost you your neck.
			Because to successfully recover the treasure, you'll have to
			survive the perils of diving in unknown waters - and the even
			greater danger of an untrustworthy crew. But none of that will
			stop you from taking the plunge. You're the type who believes
			that when stakes are this high, even when your odds are this low,
			it's worth running the risks of dealing with Cutthroats.
			<br/>
			Difficulty: Standard.

			outsmarting the powers that be.

			<firstpublished>1987</firstpublished>
			<genre>Espionage</genre>
			<group>Infocom</group>
			<description>
			Where the Iron Curtain divides East and West, the frontier is a
			no man's land between freedom and captivity, a place where moments
			lost or precautions not taken exact a toll in men's lives. In
			Border Zone, you cross this barrier not once, but three times, as
			three different characters in a fast-paced story of international
			intrigue.
			<br/>
			The pulse-pounding tension of espionage is heightened by the
			addition of real time, which ticks on regardless of your actions.
			As you race against the clock to complete your missions, you'll
			find yourself caught up in a spine-tingling adventure that's far
			more suspenseful than any spy thriller you've ever read.
			<br/>
			The story begins on the train to Litzenburg, a peaceful country
			just outside the Iron Curtain. In the border town of Ostnitz,
			Constitution Day festivities include a speech by the American
			ambassador. But plans are afoot to destabilize this key neutral
			territory by assassinating the diplomat. Speeding towards the
			border through the Eastern bloc country of Frobnia are an
			easy-going American businessman, an ambitious young American
			spy, and a ruthless KGB agent. All three are soon to be entangled
			in the assassination plot, their lives intertwining as each
			carries out his perilous assignment.
			<br/>
			You'll see the story from three viewpoints, as you step into the
			soes of a different major character in each of the three chapters
			of Border Zone. Set in separate locations on or near the border,
			the chapters are complete stories in themselves, each with its
			pwn riveting conclusion.
			<br/>
			The on-line hints in Border Zone will help you out when you need
			it. But hints take you only so far. Even when you know exactly
			what to do, discretion and timing are crucial as you outwit the
			KGB, evade a snarling pack of search dogs, make a desperate
			assault on the border, and count down the moments to the
			assassination.
			<br/>
			Border Zone was written by Marc Blank, a pioneer in interactive
			fiction and the author of such ground-breaking works as Zork and
			Deadline. In Border Zone, Marc takes the clever plotting and
			masterly prose of a top-notch thriller, brings it to life through
			interactive fiction, and intensifies the experience with the
			addition of real time.
			<br/>
			So steel your nerves, and don't blow your cover, friend. You've
			a long way to go before you come in from the cold.

			<description>
			Dread times have befallen the Kingdom of Quendor. The wizards
			have mysteriously disappeared. The Enchanter's Guild Hall lies
			in ruins. Villages are abandoned, drunken men mutter strange
			tales, and vicious monsters haunt the streets and wastelands.
			Now it falls to you, a lowly peasant, to unravel the meaning
			behind these ominous events. Will you accept the challenge?
			<br/>
			Of course you will. For you're a hardy adventurer, ready to
			confront the most fearsome foe. And in Beyond Zork, you have
			an arsenal of new weapons and abilities at your disposal.
			<br/>
			You start by designing your own character. Choose from such
			diverse attributes as strength, endurance, compassion, and
			luck, or let the computer select for you. As you venture
			onward, your character will evolve, reflecting your success
			in your quest.
			<br/>
			Beyond Zork's sophisticated new interface makes interaction
			more natural than ever. In the heat of battle, the special
			function keys let you strike the decisive blow with a single
			keystroke. There's even an on-screen map to chart your progress!
			<br/>
			As you grow in experience and abilities, you realize that you're
			being prepared for a great task, a task of which you know
			nothing... as yet. Your search for the answer will lead you
			deep underground, where unspeakable monsters guard the world's
			most fabulous treasure - the fabled Coconut of Quendor.
			<br/>
			Beyond Zork was written by Brian Moriarty, award-winning author
			of Wishbringer and Trinity. Fans of Infocom's fantasy series will
			recognise characters and locations from previous stories, while
			old and new players alike will enjoy exploring the Zorkian
			landscape as their challenge increases and their character
			grows in strength and power.

			"Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone, is rightwise king
			of England."
			<br/>
			In the days before Camelot, when magic and evil rule England, a
			sword sheathed in stone appears in a quiet churchyard. Engraved
			upon it are words which form your destiny. For you are Arthur,
			the son and true heir of the High King, Uther Pendragon.
			<br/>
			But there is more to asserting your claim than wresting free the
			sword. The sword in the stone disappears - stolen by the evil
			King Lot. To win it back, you must develop the kingly qualities
			of wisdom, chivalry, and experience, qualities that will also
			prove you worthy of the throne. And you must do it all within
			three days, or Lot will usurp your legacy.
			<br/>
			You are assisted by Merlin the Enchanter, who grants you the
			power to transform yourself into a variety of animals. Now you
			can explore the kingdom as no one has before: from the sky, from
			rivers and lakes, from on - and under - the earth. How you
			use this power, and how you solve the myriad puzzles that
			confront you, will determine your success in your quest.
			<br/>
			Merlin's crystal ball reveals helpful hints. The undo command lets
			you rescind even the most foolhardy of decisions. Optional on-screen
			mapping gives your quest direction. A medieval Book of Hours has
			been magically cast into each and every Arthur package, along
			with the game disk and complete instructions.
			<br/>
			Now prepare to claim your birthright as king born of all England.
			It's your chance to live the legend.

			<description>"If you can look into the seeds of time, and say
			which grain will grow and which will not..." - Shakespeare
			<br/>
			It's 2031. The world is on the brink of chaos. In the United
			States of North America, spiraling crime and unemployment rates,
			decayed school systems and massive government regulations have
			led to a lazy, contentious society.
			<br/>
			To reverse this critical situation, government and industry
			leaders have developed a Plan combining the economic freedom
			and strong moral values of the 1950s with the technological
			advancements of the 21st century. Will the Plan ensure peace
			and prosperity? Or will it set the earth on a suicide course
			to destruction?
			<br/>
			As the world's first conscious, intelligent computer, only you
			can visit places that have never been seen before. Only you
			can view the future. And only you know what must be done to
			save humanity.
			<br/>
			A major departure for Infocom, "A Mind Forever Voyaging" is
			reminiscent of such classic works of science fiction as
			Brave New World and 1984. You'll spend less time solving
			puzzles, as you explore realistic worlds of the future.
			<br/>
			Difficulty: Advanced.
